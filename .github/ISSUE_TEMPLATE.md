<!--

The Clair developers only support the Clair API.
They do not support or operate any third party client (e.g. clairctl, klar, harbor).
If you are using a third party client, please create issues on their respective repositories.

Are you using a development build of Clair (e.g. quay.io/coreos/clair-git)?
Your problem might be solved by switching to a stable release (e.g. quay.io/coreos/clair).

Issues that do not contain the Environment section will be automatically closed.
If you're making a feature request, please specify "N/A" under the environment section.
Nobody can help you without context.
